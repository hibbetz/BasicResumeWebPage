  <p> A capable worker with a lot of dedication to see a job finished and to the utmost standard. Interchangeable skill set between any process within the FC with a clear desire to improve as much as possible in terms of both being able to learn from others at my level of expertise and higher ups but also to improve solitarily and perfecting my skills. A person able to see the bigger picture and do what needs to be done in any capacity to move projects forward or to complete a goal. Someone who values the team over the individual to help maintain and achieve goals and recognises achievements attained through group effort. </p>

    <li> <a href="https://www.staffs.ac.uk/">Staffordshire University </a> 2014-2018 - Computer Games Design graduating with a Second Class Lower Divison (2.2)</li>

      <li> <span id="CompanyName"> <strong><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/1737160Z:LN">Amazon UK Services ltd.</a></strong> </span> 2018 - Present </li>
      <li> Success Stories:     Cross trained in Receive, Shipping and ICQA</li>

      <li> Unofficially coaching new associates on better stowing techniques/practices and tips on keeping their rates high and errors low alongside another long-time associate. Coached associate went on to consistently achieve well above 150% performance. Continued this trend during peak 2019 in which, while performing indirect duties, would talk to the temporary hired associates, answered any and all questions/concerns raised and offered advice on stowing to maximise their potential and their value to the warehouse targets.  </li>

    <li>Positive appraisal from Area Manager for raising and escalating safety issues in the FC – for example an instance of a tote containing over 20kg of item weight on the top rack of the u-boat which would most assuredly cause injury to an associate. Another example being raising a concern with a broken fan cable which, left unattended, would cause serious damage to an associate or be a serious potential fire hazard, issue was resolved straight away. This shows Ownership in the way of owning the problem and taking it to the right people. </li>  

    <li>Positive feedback and rewards for high quality and consistent performance as an Indirect, being a point of call when an indirect is urgently needed due to consistency and skill. Even showing the capability of carrying out two indirect processes (down stacking and cart running) for 10 stowers on a single floor. Showing: Earn Trust, Bias for Action and Deliver Results. </li>

<h4 class="SubSection"> <em> Extra-Curricular:</em> </h4>

<p> Studying for an IT Certification exam (CompTIA’s A+ certification), going so far as to take the first half exam in Mid-January (exam is split into two: 1001 and 1002) and getting a passing grade. Currently studying for the second half of the exam with the date of exam TBD. Showing I am dedicated when putting my mind on something even when unprompted or required to, as this exam is entirely option and done in my own time for my own enjoyment.  This almost certainly applies to the Amazon Principle of: Learn and be Curious. </p>
